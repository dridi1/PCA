# Introduction:

![](Flag_of_Tunisia.svg.png){width="88" height="58"}

-   Tunisia, a North African country with a rich history and diverse cultural heritage, has experienced significant emigration over the past few decades.

-   In this project, we aim to study the various opinions on Tunisian emigration.

-   The survey: The survey was created using Google Forms and distributed to respondents mainly through Gmail. The data was then collected in an Excel file and subsequently processed using the R programming language.

```

# data overview:

```{r}
paste("In our data, We have",ncol(data),"variable And",nrow(data),"Observation")
```

# Descriptive statistics:

## Sexe Pie chart:

```{r}
data$sexe<-factor(data$sexe,levels=c("Male","Female"))
freq=table((data$sexe))
perc<- round(freq/sum(freq)*100)
labls1 <- paste(c("Male","Female"),perc)
labls1 <- paste(labls1,"%",sep="")
pie(freq,labels = labls1,col=c("blue", "pink"),main="Distribution of Gender")
```

> The chart effectively visualizes the nearly equal distribution between males and females, highlighting gender eaqual distribution within the dataset.

## Age Pie chart:

```{r}
data$sexe<-factor(data$Age,levels=c("Between 18 and 25","Over 40"))
freq=table((data$Age))
perc <- round(freq/sum(freq)*100)
labls1 <- paste(c("Between 18 and 25,","Over 40,"),perc)
labls1 <- paste(labls1,"%",sep="")
pie(freq,labels = labls1, col=rainbow(length(labls1)),main="Distribution of Age")
```

> The chart highlights a notable disparity in age distribution, with a substantial majority of individuals falling within the 18 to 25 age range.

## Education Pie chart:

```{r}
data$education<-factor(data$education,levels=c("University education","Primary education"))
freq=table((data$education))
perc <- round(freq/sum(freq)*100)
labls1 <- paste(c("University education","Primary education"),perc)
labls1 <- paste(labls1,"%",sep="")
pie(freq,labels = labls1, col=rainbow(length(labls1)),main="Distribution of Education")
```

> This char reveals a significant educational trend.

## country of choice Pie chart:

```{r}
data$Country_of_choice<-factor(data$Country_of_choice,levels=c("Germany","Other","Italy","Canada","France","U_S_A"))
freq=table((data$Country_of_choice))
perc <- round(freq/sum(freq)*100)
labls1 <- paste(c("Germany","Other","Italy","Canada","France","U_S_A"),perc)
labls1 <- paste(labls1,"%",sep="")
pie(freq,labels = labls1, col=rainbow(length(labls1)),main="Distribution of country of choice")
```

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

## Perform Principal Component Analysis:

```{r}
X2=as.matrix(data[,22:31])
res.pca2 <- PCA (X2,graph=F)
```

## Calculating eigenvalues from PCA results:

```{r}
#get the eignvalue
eig_val2 <- res.pca2$eig

#transform to a better table
eig_val2<-data.frame(eig_val2)
DIM <- paste("Dim.", 1:10, sep = "")
eig_val2 <- cbind(DIM,eig_val2)
ft <- flextable(eig_val2)
ft <- autofit(ft)
theme_zebra(ft)
```

## Extracting variables from PCA results:

```{r}
var1 <- get_pca_var(res.pca2)
var1
```

## Correlation plot using cosÂ²:

```{r}
corrplot(var1$cos2,tl.cex = 0.8, is.corr=F)
```

> The higher the cos2, the better the variable is represented. Our variables demonstrate high correlation with the first dimension.

## Coordinates of variables:

```{r}
s<-res.pca2$var$coord
s<-data.frame(s)
Question <- paste("Q.", 1:10, sep = "")
s <- cbind(Question,s)
ft <- qflextable(s)
ft <- autofit(ft)
theme_zebra(ft)
```

```{r}
fviz_eig(res.pca2, addlabels = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 50))
```

> According to the Elbow criterion, we observe a bend (elbow) followed by a decrease. We select the axes before the elbow. Based on the scree plot presented above, the number of axes to retain is 3.

-   Kaiser Criterion: We have 2 eigenvalues greater than 1. \newline
-   Elbow Criterion: The elbow is at the level of the third axis. \newline
-   Cumulative Inertia Criterion: The first two axes have a cumulative inertia rate of 64.36%.
\newline **Decision**: We retain the first two axes.

## Visualize variables plot for axes 1 and 2:

```{r}
fviz_pca_var(res.pca2, axes=c(1,2), col.var="cos2") +
scale_color_gradient2(low="white", mid="blue",
                      high="red", midpoint=0.6)
```

-   The first two dimensions contain 64.36% of the total inertia. \newline
-   The further from the origin indicate better presentation like environmental factors. \newline
-   Variables : personal safety, investment in education, access to justice, legal rights and justice, and healthcare services are closely clustered, indicating a strong correlation among them. \newline
-   The same for variables : better quality of life ,public transportation ,environmental pollution and environmental factors. 

## PCA Plot of Individuals with Cos2 Values:

```{r}
fviz_pca_ind(res.pca2,geom ="text",col.ind="cos2")+
scale_color_gradient2(low="blue", mid="white",
high="red", midpoint=0.5)

```

```{r}
plot.PCA(res.pca2, axes=c(1, 2), choix="ind", cex=0.7)

```

# Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA):

## Performing Multiple Correspondence Analysis:

```{r}
res.mca <- MCA (data[,3:8], graph = FALSE)
```

## Calculating eigenvalues from MCA results:

```{r}
d<-data.frame(res.mca$eig)
DIM <- paste("Dim.", 1:6, sep = "")
d <- cbind(DIM,d)
ft <- flextable(d)
ft <- autofit(ft)
theme_zebra(ft)
```

## Scree Plot for Multiple Correspondence Analysis :

```{r}
fviz_screeplot(res.mca)
```

```{r}
fviz_mca_var(res.mca,repel = TRUE,ggtheme = theme_minimal ())
```

-   It's just a matter of identifying the clusters of modalities that are close on the map. \newline 
-   We have a first group of modalities on the left, consisting of modalities : migrated_to_another_country_before_no , satisfation_no , considered_emigration_from_tunisia_yes . \newline -\> whose interpretation is as follows: individuals who want to emigrate from tunisia \newline
-   Second groupe: difficulties_in_obtaining_necessary_documentation_for_emigration_no ,actively_pursuing_emigration_plans_no ,considered_emigration_from_tunisia_no ,satisfaction_yes . \newline -\> whose interpretation is as follows: individuals who doesn't want to emigrate from tunisia.

```{r}
fviz_mca_biplot(res.mca,
col.ind="cos2",
invisible ="var",repel = TRUE,
ggtheme = theme_minimal ())

```

# Classification:

The idea of classifying various elements of a dataset into multiple categories is to group the data based on their similarity. Since the data share common characteristics, it is easier to predict their behavior. 
## Performing classification:

```{r}
res.pca <- PCA(X2, ncp = 4, graph = FALSE)
res.hcpc <- HCPC(res.pca,nb.clust = 4, graph = FALSE)
HCPC (res.pca, nb.clust = 4, graph = TRUE)
```
```{r}
res.hcpc$desc.var
```

```{r}
fviz_cluster(res.hcpc,
repel = TRUE,
show.clust.cent = TRUE,
palette = "jco",
ggtheme = theme_minimal(),
main = "Factor map"
)

```

Observed Classes: \newline - Cluster_1 [18-31-35]\newline - Cluster_2 [9-8-26-30-19-27-28-10-21-11-25-14-20-32-22-27]\newline - Cluster_3 [23-29-1-15-12-2-24-13]\newline - Cluster_4 [1-5-3-6-34-4-33-17]\newline - Each Cluster present a groupe of individuals.\newline - Each cluster seems to have distinct characteristics based on the quantitative variables.\newline - Cluster 1 has lower scores in categories like environmental pollution, healthcare services, and access to justice compared to other clusters. \newline - Cluster 2 has a significantly higher mean in healthcare services compared to the overall mean.\newline - Cluster 3 shows higher scores in investment in education and personal safety compared to other clusters.\newline - Cluster 4 exhibits higher scores in environmental factors and public transportation. \newline -  "Public_transportation" seems to be strongly associated with Clusters 1 and 4, as indicated by their high Eta2 values and low P-values. \newline - Similarly, "Environmental_factors" appear to be linked with Clusters 1, 3, and 4.
